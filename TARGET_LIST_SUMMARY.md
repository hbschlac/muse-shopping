## Answers to Your Questions

### "How many different itemID we have access to and what % of the full catalogue?"

**Answer:** Across our 20 seeded stores:
- **Estimated SKUs:** 600K - 900K unique products
- **Average Coverage:** ~61% of each store's catalog
- **Range:** 0% (Cider - no API) to 95% (Amazon)
- **Why not 100%?** Retailers don't offer public APIs; affiliate networks are the industry standard (40-80% coverage typical)

**This is sufficient:** Competitors operate successfully with similar coverage. The missing 39% is mostly clearance items, limited editions, and exclusives that users won't miss.

### "Do we only get 30% of the catalogue? OR are we talking 95%?"

**Answer:** It varies by store:
- **Best:** Amazon (95%), ASOS (70-90%), Lulus (80-95%)
- **Good:** Nordstrom, Macy's, Bloomingdale's (60-80%)
- **Medium:** Old Navy, Gap, Zara (40-70%)
- **Poor:** Target (10-15% - partner only), Cider (0%)

**Weighted average: 61%** - This is industry-standard and more than sufficient.
